"""
This code is meant for an AWS lambda.
Persona, a web service that manages users, sends user data
to this lambda in order to index it in elasticsearch.

Please note that we use two indices here: member and members.
The former (member) is used for legacy purposes. It has the concept of virtual studies.
The latter (members) is meant to be used in the service kf-api-arranger,
Members index and has no concept of virtual studies.
